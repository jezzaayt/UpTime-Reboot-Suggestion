# Idea

Thought of some ideas and used AI to help implement this quickly for my own purposes, with the libraries to use. As I would often just have my PC on and sleep it every day. I know a reboot would be good once in a while, so a notification. Realized this to also grow some projects on here while I was on a bus trip and considering ideas to build. 

All working on Windows 11, do kind of have an idea to implement it on an linux system when I get a VM again.

If want to change from default of 14 days to a different amount of days, then add in a file of day.txt to the folder tree with a single numeric value and it will then be used.
